## Healthy constraints

Tailwind is a set of design tokens that expand to utility classes. This makes it hard to not adhere to a pre-defined (by us) design system. You are always choosing values from a fixed set of options. While you can use arbitrary spacing, color, text size etc. it requires a lot more friction and, in PRs, sticks out like a sore thumb.

With styled-components every new chunk of CSS you write is a blank canvas; there's nothing stopping you from using whatever values you want.

## Context switching

In pursuit of perceived 'separation of concerns', styled components are defined in a separate place from the HTML (JSX) markup. This means context switching between where you write your styles and where you write your HTML. Itâ€™s difficult to hunt them down, even if they are in the same 500-line-long file, but very often, these styled components are on the other side of the codebase.

Naming a styled component `StyledDependantCard` and placing it in a separate file doesnâ€™t introduce separation. It makes the css a dependency of your HTML + adds some insurance jargon for extra confusion.

It is a little ugly and it takes a week or two to get used to, but the **~50% reduction in character count, not having to think about naming or creating separate files makes Tailwind noticeably faster to write and review.** This improved efficiency lets you focus on naming and structuring your React components instead of styled components.

## Maintenance and refactoring

We have done a lot of refactoring and porting over to the new repository and had some clear issues with styled-components. This is the point I could write most about, but since this doc is getting pretty big, I will mention just a few problems that Tailwind solves:

- **Ordering styled components in a consistent and readable way**  
  Inconsistent, hard and time-consuming. Some live next to the component, some live in another file, and some are in another folder entirely. This makes understanding what is used where very difficult.
- **Deleting styled-components is scary**  
  In a similar vain, you never know where they might be used or when you are safe to delete them. Our codebase is littered with dead components
- **Never know the consequences**  
  Upgrading and bug-fixing is difficult when itâ€™s hard to tell what it affects.
- **Itâ€™s not CSS**  
  It might seem like youâ€™re writing CSS, but you are not. styled-components are JS template strings that allow you to intertwine JS code into your CSS. The library does a lot of runtime magic to come up with browser-readable CSS. This makes it a bit tricky to refactor or move to a pure CSS solution (like Tailwind). We rely on an open source library to remain maintained, and if it doesnâ€™t, we may need to do a top-to-bottom refactor. However, with Tailwind, itâ€™s just a matter of copy-pasting the stylesheet.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Tailwind helps us write simpler code that only does only what matters and, as a result, makes things people love. ðŸ˜‰

Even though I could talk about the performance, server side rendering, editor autocompletion, linting, responsive design and the people behind tailwind (they have a book). I think the above four deserve to be talked about in more detail and relate to us as a company the most.

To address some concerns around using it at a large scale / with large teams, here are some companies using Tailwind in prod (links to pages built with Tailwind): Netflix, OpenAI, NASA, Google, Microsoft, Github, Loom, Shopify, Planetscale
